Scope and sequence
E-Shopping List

This program is meant to be a software which manages and tracks the "item" objects in your shopping list. Each "item" has a private "price" double, a private "productName" string, and a private "description" string. All "item" objects have a public method of "getPrice" which returns the double "price", a public "getName" which returns the string "name", and a public method "getDescription" which returns the string "description". All "item" objects  will be stored in a list of "items". There will be a "computePrice" method  which add up all the doubles from returned by the "getPrice" method of all "item" objects to calculate the total cost of the shopping list. The software itself will have a GUI. The GUI of the software will have a 960 * 540-pixel-sized window. There will be a table of the names of all "item" objects along with three bottoms--"add" which adds a new "item" object to the list, "remove" which removes an existing "item" object from the list, and "total price" which prints the double returned by the "computePrice" method as a line on the screen--on the GUI. We will spend 2 weeks for writing the codes, 3 weeks for, debug, code reviewing and commenting, and 2 weeks preparing for presentation. If time allows, we will also create an optional function of restricting add new "item" objects within a set "budget" double.
