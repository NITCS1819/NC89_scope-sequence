Scope and sequence
E-Shopping List

This program is meant to be a software which manages and tracks the "item" objects in your shopping list. Each "item" has a private "price" double, a private "productName" string, and a private "description" string. All "item" objects have a public method of "getPrice" which returns the double "price", a public "getName" which returns the string "name", and a public method "getDescription" which returns the string "description". All "item" objects  will be stored in a list of "items". There will be a "computePrice" method  which add up all the doubles from returned by the "getPrice" method of all "item" objects to calculate the total cost of the shopping list. The software itself will have a GUI.
