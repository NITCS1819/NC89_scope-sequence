Scope and sequence
E-Shopping List

This program is meant to be a software which manages and tracks the "item" objects in your shopping list. Each "item" has a "price" double, a "product name" string, and a "description" string. All "item" objects  will be stored in a list of "items". There will be a "computePrice" method  which add up all the "price" doubles of all "item" objects to calculate the total cost of the shopping list. The software itself will have a GUI.
